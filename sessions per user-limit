1. Check how many sessions were already existed for that user:

SELECT count(*) as connections,username FROM v$session where username=’&USER_NAME’ GROUP BY username;






col username for a12
col profile for a19
col limit for a12
set lines 299
select a.username,b.PROFILE,b.RESOURCE_NAME,b.limit from dba_users a , dba_profiles b where a.profile=b.profile and b.RESOURCE_NAME=’SESSIONS_PER_USER’ and a.username=’&USER_NAME’;


Alter the profile with higher SESSIONS_PER_USER value.

SQL> ALTER PROFILE TEST LIMIT SESSIONS_PER_USER 10;
