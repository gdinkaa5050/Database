If you're working on a backup alert that says invalid un/pw for sys and the sys pw doesnt work. These are things you want to try:
	1. check if the orapwd file exists for the db and is being utilized:
		1. srvctl config database -d cadmin|grep "Password file"
		2. if blank then recreate the orapwdfile
			1. Run the following as the oracle user (changing the DB name etc)
				1. $ORACLE_HOME/bin/orapwd dbuniquename=CM0685 file='+P392_DG1/CADMIN/orapwcadmin' entries=30 password=<pw> format=12
				2. Now you should see the orapwd file in ASMCMD in +P392_DG1/CADMIN/PASSWORD
					1. ASMCMD> ls
					2. pwdcadmin.1130.1195547995
				3. Once youve confirmed the pw is there, modify the orapwd file location to point to there
					1. srvctl modify database -db CADMIN -pwfile +P392_DG1/CADMIN/PASSWORD/pwdcadmin.1130.1195547995
				4. Confirm the db is using the correct orapwd file with srvctl config database -d cadmin|grep "Password file"
				5. Once confirmed sys pw should work
**If you do NOT know the sys pw or if it's not in vault for the DB (admin uses a different syspw) you can use the following to decrypt the TPW line in the rman file:
- log into sthstndb12
	• su - oracle
	• /atg/common/version3_0/bin/perlf -f translate -a <insert TPW line here from RMAN file in /mnt/db_backup/files/ADMIN>
	• ex: /atg/common/version3_0/bin/perlf -f translate -a flf!nqzvaflf~pauf-c847-fpna:!ezna_pnqzva.jbeyq
	• then you'll see the connect string it's using



Just to specify, the password file creation above only works for 19c DBs. For 11g, you can do

$ORACLE_HOME/bin/orapwd file=$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/orapw<sid> password=<password> force=y


yup good call 12c+ the orapwd is in asmcmd 11g theyre in the dbs directory on the OS
