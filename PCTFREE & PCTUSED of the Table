Alter the value of PCTFREE & PCTUSED of the table
PCTFREE: Minimum percentage of free space in a block; null for partitioned tables.
PCTFREE is defined as the value which keep free in a block for future rows present in the block to avoid row chaining.
Large value may improve update performance, because Oracle does not need to chain row pieces as frequently
Default value of PCTFREE is 10. If you set less than that then depend upon update, it may cause row chaining in Oracle.

PCTUSED: Minimum percentage of used space in a block; null for partitioned tables.
PCTUSED is defined the value when block relink to freelist if data becomes less than that PCTUSED defined value in a table.
If PCTUSED=40(default value) setting means that a block must become less than 40 percent full before being re-linked on the table free list.

Recommendation:
1. the value for PCTUSED should only be set above 40 when the database is short of disk space.
2. lower the value for PCTUSED, the less I/O your system will have at insert time, and the faster your system will run.

Note: Some basic point need to remember when need to change the PCTFREE and PCTUSED parameter for a table
•The sum of PCTFREE and PCTUSED must be equal to or less than 100.
•If the sum equals 100, then Oracle attempts to keep no more than PCTFREE free space, and processing costs are highest.
•The smaller the difference between 100 and the sum of PCTFREE and PCTUSED (as in PCTUSED of 75, PCTFREE of 20), the more efficient space usage is, at some performance cost.

Insert more 100 rows in table TEST, so more blocks used:
