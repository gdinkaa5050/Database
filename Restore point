Hello Team,


Trust everyone is doing great. I am writing to notify the entire team that I will perform active duty with the United States Army Reserves beginning On August 29th and ending January 26th, 2023. I have enjoyed my work here with Concentrix and will fully return to my job once my military obligations is met.

My last day at work before I begin military service will be August 26th. I can be reached on my personal email ggaduna@gmail.com. Please find attached my enlistment contract, and let me know if there are any concerns or procedures.

Best wishes, and I look forward to rejoining the dream team.
