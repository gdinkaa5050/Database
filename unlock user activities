Someone or some process using that id coming from omsdp140fe is providing an incorrect password, so after 10 failed login attempts it locks the account. 
You need to identify what process or person is providing the incorrect password or it will continue to lock as you can see by the 1017 return code, 
once it reached the max of 10 failed attempts it locks and you start getting a 28000 returncode that the account is locked.

SQL> select username, userhost, timestamp, returncode from dba_audit_trail where username = 'DPAC001' and returncode = '1017' order by timestamp desc
2 ;

select username, userhost, timestamp, returncode from dba_audit_trail where username = 'DPAC001' and returncode = '28000' order by timestamp desc





Why Oracle User is Locked, Who is Locking Oracle User
dbtut March 9, 2019 ORACLE

 

If an oracle user is locked, it is usually caused by an incorrect password entry. In some cases, even if you remove the user’s lock with the help of the following script it will lock again after a while.

SQL> alter user ADURUOZ account unlock;

User altered.
1
2
3
SQL> alter user ADURUOZ account unlock;
 
User altered.
This is usually due to an application server that attempts to log in with the old password.

You can use the following script to find out why the Oracle user is locked.


SELECT
  TO_CHAR(TIMESTAMP,'MM/DD HH24:MI') TIMESTAMP,
  SUBSTR(OS_USERNAME,1,20) OS_USERNAME,
  SUBSTR(USERNAME,1,20) USERNAME,
  SUBSTR(TERMINAL,1,20) TERMINAL,
  ACTION_NAME,
  RETURNCODE,
   OS_USERNAME,
   USERNAME,
   USERHOST  
FROM
  SYS.DBA_AUDIT_SESSION
WHERE
  USERNAME LIKE '%write_locked_oracle_user_name_here_or_remove_this_line_for_all_users%'
  AND TIMESTAMP BETWEEN SYSDATE-1 AND SYSDATE
ORDER BY
  TIMESTAMP DESC;
You can also use the following script to find out when User is locked.

SQL> col profile for a30
SQL> col username for a30
SQL> col account_status for a20
SQL> SELECT username, account_status,lock_date, PROFILE FROM dba_users WHERE username='write_your_locked_user_name';

USERNAME		       ACCOUNT_STATUS	    LOCK_DATE	       PROFILE
------------------------------ -------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------
your_user_name	               LOCKED(TIMED)	    29-MAY-17	       DEFAULT

If the RETURNCODE value in the query is 1017, it means an incorrect password entry. Some important RETURNCODE values are as follows.

RETURNCODE = 0 – Indicates successful login.
RETURNCODE = 1017 – Indicates incorrect password entry.
RETURNCODE = 28000 – Indicates that the user is locked.
RETURNCODE = 28001 – Indicates that the user is expired.
