Someone or some process using that id coming from omsdp140fe is providing an incorrect password, so after 10 failed login attempts it locks the account. 
You need to identify what process or person is providing the incorrect password or it will continue to lock as you can see by the 1017 return code, 
once it reached the max of 10 failed attempts it locks and you start getting a 28000 returncode that the account is locked.
