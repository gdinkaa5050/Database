Check Oracle database size
There are several ways to measure the size of an Oracle database. As an Oracle DBA you may face the requirement to get the current database size. Find below the queries which you can use to find the size of the Oracle database.

Check db size – large database 

Exact database size

Check users & space used 


Check db size – large database

For very big databases where the size run into multiple GB or TB, below command will help you get a bird’s eye view on the database size, used space and free space.

 

Please Note: this query rounds off the output and hence does not show you the exact utilization

col "Database Size" format a20
col "Free space" format a20
col "Used space" format a20
select round(sum(used.bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 ) || ' GB' "Database Size"
, round(sum(used.bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 ) -
round(free.p / 1024 / 1024 / 1024) || ' GB' "Used space"
, round(free.p / 1024 / 1024 / 1024) || ' GB' "Free space"
from (select bytes
from v$datafile
union all
select bytes
from v$tempfile
union all
select bytes
from v$log) used
, (select sum(bytes) as p
from dba_free_space) free
group by free.p
/


Exact database size

The size of the database is the space the files physically consume on disk. You can find this with

select
"Reserved_Space(GB)", "Reserved_Space(GB)" - "Free_Space(GB)" "Used_Space(GB)",
"Free_Space(GB)"
from(
select 
(select sum(bytes/(1014*1024*1024)) from dba_data_files) "Reserved_Space(GB)",
(select sum(bytes/(1024*1024*1024)) from dba_free_space) "Free_Space(GB)"
from dual
);


Analyzing query output

When you run the above query, you will see below output

Reserved_Space(GB) Used_Space(GB) Free_Space(GB)
------------------ -------------- --------------
        1.43491124     1.34488439     .090026855
We can see that 1.4 GB is the allocated space across all the data files in the database. Out of the 1.4 GB allocated segments, 1.3 GB is used and 0.09 GB is free space.



Check users & space used

We can even check the amount of disk space used by users inside the database using below query

select owner, sum(bytes)/1024/1024 Size_MB from dba_segments
group  by owner;







We can use the below Query to check table size in oracle

For oracle table size in MB

select
owner as "Schema"
, segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Mb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from dba_segments
where segment_name=’<table_name>’
and owner='<Table owner>';
For oracle table size in GB

select
owner as "Schema"
, segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Gb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from dba_segments
where segment_name=’<table_name>’
and owner='<Table owner>'
and owner='<Table owner>';
If you don’t have access to dba_segments, then you can use user_segments also

For the size in MB

select segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Mb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from user_segments
where segment_name=’<table_name>’
For the size in GB

select
segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Gb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from user_segments
where segment_name=’<table_name>’;
we can also use this query to find the top ten biggest tables in a particular schema or tablespace

Top 10 big tables in Particular schema

select * from (select
owner as "Schema"
, segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Gb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from dba_segments
where owner=’<schema>’  and segment_type='TABLE' order by 4 desc)  where rownum < 11;
Top 10 big tables in Particular tablespace

select * from (select
owner as "Schema"
, segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Gb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from dba_segments
where tablespace_name =’<tablespace name>' and segment_name='TABLE' order by 4 desc ) where rownum <11;
List tables bigger than 10G

select
owner as "Schema"
, segment_name as "Object Name"
, segment_type as "Object Type"
, round(bytes/1024/1024/1024,2) as "Object Size (Gb)"
, tablespace_name as "Tablespace"
from dba_segments
where segment_type='TABLE' where bytes/1024/1024/1024 >10  order by 4 desc;
