SELECT name, value 
  FROM v$parameter
 WHERE name = 'sessions'
The number of sessions currently active

SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM v$session
As I said, though, there are other potential limits both at the database level and at the operating system level and depending on whether shared server has been configured.
If shared server is ignored, you may well hit the limit of the PROCESSES parameter before you hit the limit of the SESSIONS parameter. 
And you may hit operating system limits because each session requires a certain amount of RAM.



select current_utilization, limit_value 
    from v$resource_limit 
    where resource_name='sessions';
CURRENT_UTILIZATION LIMIT_VALUE
------------------- -----------
                110         792
Try this to show info about both:

    select resource_name, current_utilization, max_utilization, limit_value 
    from v$resource_limit 
    where resource_name in ('sessions', 'processes');
    
    
    
    select count(*),sum(decode(status, 'ACTIVE',1,0)) from v$session where type= 'USER'
    
    
    
    
    SELECT
  'Currently, ' 
  || (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM V$SESSION)
  || ' out of ' 
  || VP.VALUE 
  || ' connections are used.' AS USAGE_MESSAGE
FROM 
  V$PARAMETER VP
WHERE VP.NAME = 'sessions';
