try this, it will give you queries currently running for more than 60 seconds.
Note that it prints multiple lines per running query if the SQL has multiple lines. 
Look at the sid,serial# to see what belongs together.

select s.username,s.sid,s.serial#,s.last_call_et/60 mins_running,q.sql_text from v$session s 
join v$sqltext_with_newlines q
on s.sql_address = q.address
 where status='ACTIVE'
and type <>'BACKGROUND'
and last_call_et> 60
order by sid,serial#,q.piece




This shows locks. Sometimes things are going slow, but it's because it is blocked waiting for a lock:

select
  object_name, 
  object_type, 
  session_id, 
  type,         -- Type or system/user lock
  lmode,        -- lock mode in which session holds lock
  request, 
  block, 
  ctime         -- Time since current mode was granted
from
  v$locked_object, all_objects, v$lock
where
  v$locked_object.object_id = all_objects.object_id AND
  v$lock.id1 = all_objects.object_id AND
  v$lock.sid = v$locked_object.session_id
order by
  session_id, ctime desc, object_name

Check the current running SQL statements

set line 200 pages 200
select s.module,sql_text
from v$sqltext_with_newlines t,V$SESSION s
where t.address = s.sql_address
and t.hash_value = s.sql_hash_value
and s.status = 'ACTIVE'
and s.username is not null
order by s.sid,t.piece;

Find the Current SQL with SQL ID, Username and hash value , elapsed time, sql Text columns

set line 200 pages 200
col username for a20
select s.sid, s.username,optimizer_mode,hash_value,
address,cpu_time,elapsed_time,sql_text
from v$sqlarea q, v$session s
where s.sql_hash_value = q.hash_value
and s.sql_address = q.address
and s.username is not null;

Find SID and Serial# for the current SQL running

select s.sid,s.serial#,s.username,s.sql_id,q.sql_text
from v$sqlarea q ,v$session s
where s.sql_hash_value = q.hash_value
and s.sql_address = q.address
and s.username is not null;
